# Car Repair AI Fine-tuning Guide

This guide outlines the basic steps for fine-tuning a language model so that it can provide expert knowledge on automobile repair topics.

## 1. Collect Training Data

1. Gather text from reliable automotive repair manuals, service bulletins, and other authoritative sources.
2. Organize the text into question-and-answer pairs or explanations about specific repair scenarios.
3. Create a dataset file in JSON or CSV format that your model training framework can read.

## 2. Preprocess the Data

1. Clean the text, remove irrelevant information, and ensure that it focuses on repair tasks, diagnostics, and troubleshooting procedures.
2. Split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## 3. Choose a Base Model

Select an open-source language model that supports fine-tuning. Frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers provide many pretrained models.

## 4. Fine-tuning Script

Use the `fine_tune.py` script in this directory as a starting point. It demonstrates how to load a dataset and fine-tune a transformer model with Hugging Face's Trainer API.

## 5. Evaluate and Iterate

After training, test the model by asking it car repair questions. If it provides correct and thorough answers, the fine-tuning was successful. Otherwise, adjust your dataset or training parameters and try again.
